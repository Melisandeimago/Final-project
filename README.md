## Project descrition
The Capstone project is one of the final projects in this course and will let you demonstrate what you have learned.

## Your final Results
- Dashboard: The dashboard must be accessible without a special tool. You can choose the data visualization tool, but we encourage you to use Data Studio since sharing it is easier.
- Presentation: Keep your presentation to 10-15 minutes and include extensive speaker notes.
- Written Report: Create a written report of your analysis, in Google Docs. It must contain the necessary data and your insights in written format.
## Minimum Requirements
- Utilize at least 3 techniques that you learned in the course. Provide the details of each technique separately. As a rule of thumb, a technique in this context is something that was used as part of a sprint name in the "Main Analysis Types" module. Examples - RFM, A/B Testing, Cohort Analysis, etc. You might also want to choose the techniques based on the role that you would ideally want to apply to (product/marketing/payments analyst, etc.).
- Dashboard, presentation and written report must tell a consistent story, be logical and include useful insights.
- You may use the data of your choice, as long as it is not a source we used in the course for Hands-On or Graded Tasks. You should provide the source of your dataset in your report.
- Follow a structured approach. It is not necessary to list the six steps, but have a continuous story, and be able to point out where you covered each step.
